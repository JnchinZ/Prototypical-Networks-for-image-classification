# Prototype-network-for-image-classification
This is a very simple implementation for the NIPS 2017 paper [Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/cb8da6767461f2812ae4290eac7cbc42-Paper.pdf).
For learning only.


## Set up the Omniglot dataset
Execute `download_omniglot.sh` or place the data location as instructed by the scriptã€‚

## Train the prototypical network
Run `python run_train.py`
